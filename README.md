# Restaurant-Full-Stack

## Demonstration
Site demo video to be attached

## Deployment
The app uses local servers to host, to view the site on your device you need to clone the repository.
In both the backend and frontend folders, run:

```
npm install
```

You need to add 3 lines to the .env file in backend:

```
MONGODB_URL = ""
PORT = 4000
API_KEY = ""
```

The MongoDB url needs to be the connection string for the Atlas Cluster the application will connect to.
The Api Key needs to be a private key linked with an apiNinjas free account.
There are no dummy values provided for these.
Then in backend run: ```npm run dev``` and in frontend, run: ```npm start```

## Brief
The brief was to create a Full Stack Web Application using the MERN stack. Implementing what we had learnt throughout the course on each element of the Stack.

## Plan
We decided to create a Restaurant Website with which you could browse a menu db, see calorie information using a Nutrition API, use basket functions to perform CRUD operations on your shopping basket, and create a profile with which you could view previous orders.

## Planning and Progress Tracker
We used a shared google doc to write down some things while we brainstormed and made initial plans for how the project would take shape.
We used a miro board. A collaborative board which allowed us to make task notes, assign a priority order, assign tasks to each member and organise tasks into do, doing, and done sections. 
This assisted us in communicating with eachother who was working on what and in which files. As well as what needed to be done and in what relative order.
